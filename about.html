            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <h3>I'm a 3rd Year <span> Computer Science Student</span></h3>
            <p>I’m an aspiring tech enthusiast with a deep passion for blending creativity and innovation to build meaningful digital experiences. Throughout my journey, I’ve gained hands-on experience across a range of areas including UI/UX design, web and mobile app development, funnel design, graphic design, and video editing.
                <br><br>
                I thrive on solving problems through design and development. Whether it's designing a user interface that feels natural, developing responsive websites, building functional mobile apps, or optimizing funnels for better conversion, I aim to create solutions that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also purposeful and efficient. My work is driven by a commitment to providing seamless, user-friendly experiences across digital platforms.
                <br><br>
                My focus is on the intersection between creativity and technology, where I can apply my technical knowledge while keeping the user experience front and center. I believe every project I work on should serve a meaningful purpose and deliver value to its users, which is why I prioritize understanding the needs and goals of both clients and users in every endeavor.
                <br><br>
                I’m constantly exploring new tools and methodologies to stay at the cutting edge of design and development. Whether you’re looking for someone to build a user-centric app, design a compelling marketing funnel, or develop a visually engaging website, I’m excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with others to bring ideas to life.
                <br><br>
                If you’re interested in working together or simply want to learn more about my journey, don’t hesitate to reach out. Let’s create something amazing!</p>

                        <p>Life hasn't always been easy for us. Like many families, we faced our share of challenges — financial struggles, uncertainties in business, and personal sacrifices. There were times when ends barely met, and dreams seemed too far away. But those hardships only made our bond stronger. We learned to be resourceful, to celebrate even the smallest victories, and to keep moving forward with hope and faith.</p>
