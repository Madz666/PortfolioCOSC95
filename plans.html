                    <h3>Academic & Technical Growth</h3>
                    <p>
                        Instead of mastering everything, build a strong understanding of:
                        <br>
                        • Data Structures & Algorithms – essential for coding interviews and problem-solving.
                        <br>
                        • OOP & Design Patterns – helps write scalable, maintainable software.
                        <br>
                        • Basic Networking & Operating Systems – provides a foundation for backend, DevOps, and cloud computing.
                    </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Academic & Technical Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    Lightly explore advanced areas just enough to understand the concepts:
                    <br>
                    • Machine Learning – learn basic types (regression, classification) using tools like Scikit-learn or Google Teachable Machine.
                    <br>
                    • Cloud Computing – deploy simple web apps using Vercel, Railway, or Firebase to understand hosting and serverless.
                    <br>
                    • Distributed Systems – watch beginner explainers; learn about APIs, microservices, and real-time data basics (like sockets).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Academic & Technical Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    Build comfort with both frontend and backend:
                    <br>
                    • Frontend – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React or Next.js.
                    <br>
                    • Backend <br> - Node.js (Express) for JavaScript-based stacks
                    <br>
                    - Django (Python) for structured, beginner-friendly development
                    <br>
                    • Databases – Learn SQL with PostgreSQL and NoSQL with MongoDB for flexibility.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Creative & Personal Branding Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ll design a personal brand that reflects who I am and what I do:
                    <br>
                    • Choose a color scheme, fonts, and logo that match my style.
                    <br>
                    • Make sure my brand is consistent across my website, resume, and socials.
                    <br>
                    • Present myself clearly as a creative and technical problem solver.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Creative & Personal Branding Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ll showcase all my skills in one personal site:
                    <br>
                    • Include web development projects, design work, and photography.
                    <br>
                    • Add short case studies or notes explaining my design/dev thinking.
                    <br>
                    • Use tools like Next.js, Framer, or Webflow to reflect both function and style.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Creative & Personal Branding Growth</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ll start sharing my work and process to grow visibility:
                    <br>
                    • Post behind-the-scenes content, tutorials, and project updates.
                    <br>
                    • Choose platforms that fit my work—Twitter for dev, Instagram for visuals, LinkedIn for career stuff.
                    <br>
                    • Document my journey as a student, creator, and builder.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Career & Freelance Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ll begin turning my skills into paid work:
                    <br>
                    • Offer services that combine my web dev, design, and funnel skills.
                    <br>
                    • Start with small clients—local businesses, creators, or coaches.
                    <br>
                    • Use Fiverr, Upwork, or outreach via Instagram, LinkedIn, and cold emails.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Career & Freelance Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ll look for real-world experience in a collaborative environment:
                    <br>
                    • Apply to internships at startups, agencies, or creative studios.
                    <br>
                    • Go for hybrid roles that mix design and development.
                    <br>
                    • Use it as a way to learn how teams manage clients, timelines, and creativity under pressure.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Career & Freelance Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ll grow my circle by connecting with like-minded creatives and developers:
                    <br>
                    • Join online communities on Discord, Reddit, and Twitter.
                    <br>
                    • Attend virtual or local meetups, conferences, or design/dev jams.
                    <br>
                    • Collaborate with others on projects, or just share feedback and ideas.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Personal Development & Mindset</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ll improve the way I communicate and work:
                    <br>
                    • Learn to explain my work clearly to both technical and non-technical people.
                    <br>
                    • Manage my time better across school, freelance, and personal growth.
                    <br>
                    • Practice staying calm and curious when facing creative or technical challenges.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Personal Development & Mindset</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ll protect my energy and stay grounded:
                    <br>
                    • Set work/study boundaries so I don’t burn out.
                    <br>
                    • Keep photography and design as hobbies too—not just work.
                    <br>
                    • Take care of my body and mind—exercise, sleep, mindfulness.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="plans-box">
                <h3>Personal Development & Mindset</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ll stay focused and adapt by checking in with myself regularly:
                    <br>
                    • Set monthly or quarterly goals.
                    <br>
                    • Track what I’ve built, learned, and struggled with.
                    <br>
                    • Adjust my plan as I grow—progress over perfection.
